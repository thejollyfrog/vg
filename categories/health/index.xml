      <description>Back when I ate meat and dairy, I never thought anything of my subsequent indigestion and feeling ‘heavy’ for the rest of the day. I just thought it was genetic or that I ate too fast. I was obsessed with processed foods such as frozen pizzas or pepperamis, and I had a soft spot for cheese. Little did I know it was the main cause of my long-term stomach issues which began to become more prominent when I started college.</description>

      <description>This article aims to debunk some of the most persistent myths spouted by the meat and dairy brands, designed to deceive consumers into purchasing products which wreak havoc with their health, damage the environment and cause the suffering of billions of animals.
#1 Packaged meat is naturally red Most people don’t realise the extensive production process behind the neatly-packaged meat products they purchase from the supermarket. Meat contains a protein called myoglobin, which starts turning from red to brown once it is exposed to air.</description>

      <description>What do you think about when you hear the words ‘friendly bacteria’? Is it those tiny bottles of fermented milk, promising to beat the bloat? It’s true that dairy products like yoghurt or kefir are a common source of friendly bacteria — but, as a vegan, they don’t look so friendly after all. In this article, we take an in-depth look at probiotics and how vegans can introduce them into their diets.</description>

      <title>Is vegan “junk food” damaging our health and our reputation?</title>

      <description>In recent years there have been many vegan/plant-based conversions and much of that could be credited to an increased availability of meat and dairy alternatives. These days it is becoming common place to walk into a café and order a soya latte or step into a trendy pizza place and pick up a vegan cheese pizza.
I am pleased to see changes in the perception of veganism, but as a self-confessed “health nerd”, something seems seriously wrong.</description>

      <description>The story of Andrew Taylor’s struggle with obesity starts as many stories of obesity do. It ends, however, with this Australian losing over 117 pounds (53.07 kg) within months, and helping thousands of others do the same. How? With potatoes.
 &amp;ldquo;I REALISED THAT MY BEHAVIOUR WITH FOOD MIRRORED THAT OF AN ALCOHOLIC WITH ALCOHOL&amp;rdquo;
 Overweight, Andrew was determined to diet, so he could return to a healthy lifestyle. As a vegan, he tried everything from green smoothies to healthy-meal alternatives like lentil bolognese without ever achieving durable success.</description>
