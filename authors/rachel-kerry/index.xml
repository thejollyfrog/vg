      <description>Walking through the alley between Gallowtree Gate and Market Square, I had a pleasant surprise. It was Sunday and raining but the market place was brimming with people. Not just people but vegan and open-minded people. The best kind. I’ll hold my hands up now and say I wasn’t expecting this. The idea of Leicester’s own vegan market being a big hit seemed bizarre to me, probably because as a relatively new vegan I didn’t know many vegans in Leicester.</description>
